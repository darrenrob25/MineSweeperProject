# MineSweeper
This game is a browser based version of the Minesweeper videogame originally created by Microsoft in the 1990's. The idea of the game is to clear all of the cells which don't contain a mine; if you click on a square with a mine it's game over! Once you have completed a level you can click new game to start a new one.
